# ReadinessProbe:
Purpose:
The “readinessProbe” is used to determine whether the container is ready to accept incoming network traffic. 
It’s typically used to ensure that a container has started and is in a good state to serve requests.

Action on Failure:
In case the readiness probe fails, the container is temporarily removed from the service’s pool, and it won’t receive incoming requests. However, the container is not restarted.

Example Use Case:
At the initiation of a web application, the readiness probe verifies critical components such as established database connections, loaded configurations, and readiness of all dependencies. It ensures that the application only begins to receive traffic once all these essential elements are confirmed to be in a functional state.

# LivenessProbe:
Purpose:
The “livenessProbe” serves the crucial role of determining the ongoing availability and health status of a container. 
If this probe indicates a failure, Kubernetes initiates corrective measures, often by restarting the container, to maintain the continuous availability of the application.

Action on Failure:
In case the liveness probe fails, Kubernetes takes responsive actions, typically involving a container restart. This ensures that the application within the container is restored to a healthy state.

Example Use Case:
Consider a scenario where a web server application in a container encounters issues, leading to unresponsiveness or a crash. The liveness probe acts as a watchdog, detecting such anomalies and triggering an automatic container restart. This functionality is vital for sustaining the reliability and availability of the application within a Kubernetes environment.
