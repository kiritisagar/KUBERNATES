When multiple pods are scheduled on the same node, they can communicate with each other directly using localhost or the loopback interface. 
This communication happens through the podâ€™s assigned IP address within the cluster, typically in the form of a Virtual Ethernet (veth) pair. 
The communication occurs at the network layer, enabling high-performance and low-latency interactions between pods on the same node.


# 1. Create Two Pods (App and Database)
# (app-pod.yml):

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-pod
  labels:
    app: webapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

# (db-pod.yml):
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: db-pod
  labels:
    app: database
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mysql-container
    image: mysql:5.7
    env:
    - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      value: rootpassword
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3306

# 2. Deploy the Pods
kubectl apply -f app-pod.yml
kubectl apply -f db-pod.yml


# 3. Verify Pod Status
kubectl get pods

# 4. Get Pod IP Addresses
kubectl get pods -o wide

# 5. Test Pod-to-Pod Communication via IP
