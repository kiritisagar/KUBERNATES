 Within the Same Pod: Containers can communicate via localhost and shared volumes.
Between Pods: Use Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP) and DNS names to communicate between Pods across the cluster.
Across Namespaces: Use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for cross-namespace communication.
External Communication: Use Ingress, NodePort, or LoadBalancer services to expose Pods outside the cluster.
Network Policies: Control and restrict communication using Network Policies.
