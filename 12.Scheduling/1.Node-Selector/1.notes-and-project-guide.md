A Node Selector in Kubernetes is used to constrain the scheduling of pods to specific nodes based on labels.

# Here are key points about Node Selectors:
1. Node Labels
Each node in a Kubernetes cluster can have one or more labels (key-value pairs).

Example:
nodeSelector:
  disktype: ssd
This ensures that pods are scheduled on nodes labeled with disktype: ssd.


3. Limitations
NodeSelector is simple but limited in flexibility.
It only allows for exact matches on labels. If the label is not present or doesnâ€™t match, the pod will not be scheduled.
4. Alternative Approaches
For more complex scheduling, Node Affinity is a preferred option as it allows for more flexible expressions.
Node Affinity supports operators like In, NotIn, Exists, and DoesNotExist to fine-tune scheduling behavior.
5. Node Selector vs. Taints and Tolerations
NodeSelector ensures a pod is scheduled on specific nodes, while Taints and Tolerations are more about excluding pods from certain nodes unless they have a matching toleration.




Step 1: Check Existing Nodes
kubectl get nodes

Step 2: Label the Node(s)
kubectl label node node01 disktype=ssd

Check if the node has been labeled successfully:
kubectl get nodes --show-labels

Step 3: Create Pod with nodeSelector

Step 4: Apply the Pod Manifest
kubectl apply -f pod-with-nodeselector.yaml
