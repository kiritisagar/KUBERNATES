In Kubernetes, a ResourceQuota is used to limit the amount of resources (like CPU, memory, storage, and the number of objects) that a namespace can use. It helps prevent a single namespace from consuming too many resources in a shared cluster environment.

Key Benefits of Resource Quotas:
Resource Management: Limits resource consumption like CPU, memory, or storage within a namespace.
Fair Usage: Ensures that different teams or applications using the same cluster get a fair share of resources.
Object Count Limitation: Controls the number of objects (pods, services, configmaps, etc.) that can be created in a namespace.

Namespace: A namespace is a virtual cluster within a Kubernetes cluster that provides a way to divide and isolate resources. Resource quotas are applied at the namespace level.

Resource Types: Kubernetes allows you to define quotas for various resource types, including CPU (measured in CPU units or cores) and memory (measured in bytes or other units). Quotas can also be set for persistent volume claims and the number of objects like pods, services, and secrets.

Quota Specifications: A resource quota is defined by specifying the maximum amount of each resource that can be consumed within a namespace. For example, you can set a CPU limit of 4 cores and a memory limit of 8 GB for a particular namespace.

Hard and Soft Limits: Quota specifications can have both hard and soft limits. The hard limit defines the maximum allowed resource usage and once reached, it prevents any further resource allocation. The soft limit, also known as the “quota limit,” serves as a warning threshold. It triggers notifications but doesn’t enforce any action.

Request and Limit: In Kubernetes, each pod specifies the amount of CPU and memory it requests (known as “request”) and the maximum it can consume (known as “limit”). The sum of requests and limits of all pods within a namespace is used to calculate resource utilization against the quota.

Resource Quota Enforcement: Kubernetes enforces resource quotas by rejecting new pod creations or updates that exceed the defined limits. Pods already running before the quota is enforced continue to run but are not allowed to exceed the limits.

Resource Quota Scopes: Kubernetes supports two types of quota scopes. Cluster-scoped quotas apply to all namespaces in the cluster, while namespace-scoped quotas are specific to a particular namespace.

Limits — define the maximum amount of resources a container can use.

Requests — define the minimum amount of resources that should be reserved for a container.
