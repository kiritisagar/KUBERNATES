# KUBERNATES

Kubernetes uses a YAML file called kubeconfig to store cluster authentication information for kubectl . kubeconfig contains a list of contexts to which kubectl refers when running commands. By default, the file is saved at $HOME/. kube/config .

The default location of the kubeconfig file is ~/. kube/config .
